# SVG Icons

## Hello viewer!

This is my SVG icons project which done using html, css, js.
This project consists of 5 svg icons which includes star, galaxy, globe, saturn, orbit. These 5 icons have animated effects on them. Beside the icons one mesmerising button has been placed with perfect bored animated effect which gives uniqueness to the click button.

## TASK GIVEN
Project had its own demand, we had to make a webpage of 5 svg icons with animation on them, so i decided to use different icons which were created in illustrator to give them originality.
